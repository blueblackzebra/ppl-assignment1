# Assumptions

1. Grammar is assumed to be right associative for arithmetic and boolean operations.
2. Source code's file name is to be passed as command line argument during execution. (Example: `./a.out t1.txt`)
3. Jagged array indexing starts from 1.

Enumeration for terminal and non-terminal was not required as per problem statement. So we have used string comparison.
